# Standards Offsite NYC 2016

![The standards offsite is located at the corner of 9th Avenue and 16th street](../images/offsite-location.png)

## Overview
A two-day offsite for the Chrome Standards Team (our first!). We'll be:

- Getting to know each other better
- Sharing what's working and what could be better
- Deciding what to build & do to help the broader team succeed

The first day (August 16th) will be spent in both the city and the office getting to know each other, our mission, and our challenges. Bring shoes you'll feel comfortable walking in!

The second day (August 17th) will focus on un-conference sessions we decide on collaboratively. Please add and vote on proposed talks on the [talks page](https://unconference.io/talks).

## Who?

You!  The offsite is optional, but if you spend time working on standards development or help those who do through these processes, please consider attending. We can make some sessions available for remote participation, so if you let us know ahead of time (along with your time zone and specific topics of interest, if any), we'll try to accommodate.
